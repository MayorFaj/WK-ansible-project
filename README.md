# Brief Overview
This documentation outlines the setup outlined the setup of 2 web servers  using Apache as the backend web server and HAProxy as the load balancer. Several hardening techniques was performed on the priovided Linux machines to enhance security and protect against common threats.

### Why Apache for backend webservers?
A server running on Apache is a great choice for most websites. Itâ€™s easy to use, customizable, and has a vast library of resources for users to take advantage of.
Depending on the nature and size of the website, another option may be better.

### Why HAProxy for loadbalancer?
HAProxy has built-in reliability features, such as server health checks, connection queuing, and session persistence, contribute to its reputation for fault tolerance. Although this setup is just a basic setup, HAProxy performs well in benchmarks as well.

## SSH Server hardening

###  Keep Linux Kernel and Software Up to Date;
Applying security patches is an important part of maintaining Linux server, regularly updating the Linux kernel and software packages is essential to address vulnerabilities 

## OS hardening by secure SSH
- Change SSH default port from 22 to 2222

## Disable root login
Disable root login to add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.
This option will prevent a potential attacker from logging into your server directly as root. It also encourages good operational security practices on your part, such as operating as a non-privileged user and using sudo to escalate privileges only when absolutely needed.
sudo does greatly enhances the security of the system without sharing root password with other users and admins.

## Enable SELinux
SELinux is either enabled or disabled in the Linux kernel. And changing between enabled and disabled state requires a system reboot.

## Setup firewall using firewalld
Configure firewall rules to control incoming and outgoing network traffic

## No Non-Root Accounts Have UID Set To 0
Confirm that only root account have UID 0 with full permissions to access the system.

Commands

`ansible-playbook -i inventory/dev playbooks/site.yml -b`




SELinux;

- Regular permissions are always evaluated first
- SELinux MAC is used to further fine tune access permissio;ns
- a user that doesn't have file system permissions as defined by the discretionary access control, won't get access regardless the SELinux policy settings, even if SELinux policy makes it wide open, it doesn't matter if you don't have the file system permissions

Understanding SELinux states;
SELinux is either enabled or disabled in the Linux kernel. And changing between enabled and disabled state requires a system reboot.
SELinux messages are sent to the auditd process and this process writes messages to `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. And the SELinux related messages themselves are marked with AVC, which stands for Access Vector Cache

`grep AVC /var/log/audit/audit.log`
